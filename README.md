Review: About Me
To begin with I have had minimal experience with embedded linux systems, but I have had experience in legacy C and C++, as well as Linux system administration.

Overview
The author is a very efficient writer and explains concepts in a very easy to understand, concise way. If you have had experience with C programming and basic Linux system administration you will understand the examples he presents and walks through. The author provides excellent examples in the form of diagrams and Linux command line screenshots that help to reinforce what is being explained. Furthermore, the author provides EXCELLENT resources at the end of each chapter to steer the reader towards more "in-depth" texts. These resources are incredibly useful as they serve to help keep the book up-to-date.

In Response to Other Reviews
- The author does provide links to community based embedded Linux systems in Chapter 2. and recommends the system he is running, for the examples seen throughout the book.

- I agree that it would be nice to see more links and references to more community projects but it should in no way affect the potential buyer (the author provides plenty of examples, but take into account that the book is a static entry, he can't continuously update it to keep current with technology).

For the Potential Buyer
- This is a primer, do not expect a "cookbook" format, as that is not the intent of the author. The primer approach is meant to educate you on the big picture and prepare you to go into more depth. If you purchase this book with this in mind you will absolutely not be disappointed.

- The author speaks clearly and simply to educate on the issues that are pertinent to embedded systems.

Expectations of the Reader:
The author expects the reader to be able to understand two things in order to follow along in the book:
(1) The ability to read C code and,
(2) Familiarity with Linux system administration

Review: In my work, I not infrequently have to familiarize myself with different technologies. I generally don't have a lot of time to do this.

Books like "Embedded Linux Primer" are my salvation. The author states in his preface "This book describes my view of what an embedded engineer needs to know to get up to speed fast in an embedded Linux environment". I am not an engineer, but I am a technologist and this book got me off to a flying start in terms of letting me quickly expand my knowledge of embedded Linux.

This book will not teach you how to use Linux or how to program in C and you'd best have some experience in both to even read the book.

It is not a hardware book either or a book on the Linux kernel.

It is what its title states, a primer on embedded Linux systems and how to get them up and running.

In 19 chapters, author Hallinan walks the reader through initial discussions of why to choose embedded Linux and quickly moves into the anatomy of an embedded Linux system. Hallinan's writing style is wonderfully clear and he rarely deviates from the subject at hand. There are lots of tips in the text covering the idiosyncrasies of working with an embedded system, which I found particularly helpful.

Each of the chapters is a lesson. At the end of each, there are suggestions for additional reading.

In my case, I just needed a coherent overview of embedded Linux. I got that quickly and easily thanks to Hallinan's style. Now that my initial purpose has been accomplished, I can do as Hallinan suggests: take out an old x86 system and follow along as he explains how to get an embedded Linux system up and running. Hallinan makes it a fun task.

Review: the book is a good choice for embedded developer who want to get involved in Linux embedded. Probably just for evaluation, or for a jumpstart into it.
The book provides a very good presentation style in chapter organisation and sub structure. Abstract, logical coherent walkthough a theme, summary, reference for further reading. The coverage of the general topics of embedded linux development is given so any entering developer gets a good overview whats ahead of him. Language is balanced relaxed and entertaining without being distracting. Even as a non native english person I enjoyed the reading.
some reviewers complained about missing details and how tos. This book is not a how to build a particular system solution nor provides it details down to a working solution on any aspect under regard. Why should it? Details down to source code is provided in any thinkable form in the internet. All this distributed knowledge lacks of coherence and evaluation. This is where the Primer comes in. It provides what cannot be found easily in a consumable form. Overview, Impression of complexity and probable solution pathways.

reference for those who seek knowledge rather than solutions.
